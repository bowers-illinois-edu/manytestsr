# Functions to assess the procedures via simulation. Mostly for use in the paper itself.

#' Create treatment effect, then add tau and test using the SIUP method
#'
#' This function returns a function that carries with it the environment containing the arguments.
#' The idea is to make parallelization easier.
#'
#' @param idat Individual level data
#' @param bdat Data at the block level.
#' @param blockid A character name of the column in idat and bdat indicating the block.
#' @param trtid Is the name of the treatment numeric, (0,1), variable
#' @param fmla A formula with outcome~treatment assignment  | block where treatment assignment and block must be factors.
#' @param ybase Is the potential outcome to control upon which the treatment effect will be built
#' @param prop_blocks_0 Is the proportion of blocks with no effects at all
#' @param tau_fn Is a function that turns ybase into the potential outcome under treatment --- it is a treatment effect creating function.
#' @param tau_size Is the parameter for the tau_fn --- like the true average effect size within a block.
#' @param by_block Is an argument to [create_effects] to create true effects by block or across the whole dataset
#' @param pfn A function to produce pvalues --- using idat.
#' @param afn A function to adjust alpha at each step. Takes one or more p-values plus a stratum or batch indicator.
#' @param p_adj_method Is "split" to use [findBlocks] for top-down testing and "fdr" or "holm" etc to use [stats::p.adjust] and do the test in every block.
#' @param nsims Is the number of simulations to run --- each simulation uses the same treatment effects be re-assigns treatment (re-shuffles treatment and re-reveals the observed outcomes as a function of the potential outcomes)
#' @param ncores Tells p-value functions how many cores to use. Mostly ignored in use of this function because we are tending to parallelize at higher loops.
#' @param splitfn A function to split the data into two pieces --- using bdat
#' @param covariate is the name of a covariate to be used in created covariate dependent treatment effects. If NULL then the tau_fn should not use a covariate. If "newcov", then create a new covariate with a known (moderate) relationship with the potential outcome under control. This relationship is currently fixed with an R^2 of about .1.
#' @param splitby A string indicating which column in bdat contains a variable to guide splitting (for example, a column with block sizes or block harmonic mean weights or a column with a covariate (or a function of covariates))
#' @param thealpha Is the error rate for a given test (for cases where alphafn is NULL, or the starting alpha for alphafn not null)
#' @param stop_splitby_constant TRUE is the algorithm should stop splitting when the splitting criteria is constant within set/parent or whether it should continue but split randomly.
#' @param return_details TRUE means that the function should return a list of
#' the original data ("detobj"), a summary of the results ("detresults"), and a
#' node level dataset  ("detnodes"). Default here is FALSE. Only use TRUE when
#' not using simulations.
#' @return A pvalue for each block

#' Calculate the error and success proportions of tests for a single iteration
#'
#' @description
#' This function takes output from [findBlocks] or an equivalent bottom-up testing function such as `adjust_block_tests`
#' and returns the proportions of errors made. To use this function the input to findBlocks must include a column containing a true block-level effect.
#' Repeated uses of this function allow us to assess false discovery rates and family wise error rates among other metrics of testing success.
#'
#' @param testobj Is an object arising from \code{\link{findBlocks}} or \code{\link{adjust_block_tests}}. It will contain block-level results.
#' @param truevar_name Is a string indicating the name of the variable containing the true underlying causal effect (at the block level).
#' @param trueeffect_tol Is the smallest effect size below which we consider the effect to be zero (by default is it floating point zero).
#' @param blockid A character name of the column in idat and bdat indicating the block.
#' @param thealpha Is the error rate for a given test (for cases where alphafn is NULL, or the starting alpha for alphafn not null)
#' @param fwer Indicates that we are trying to control FWER. Right now, we do this by default in report_detections but this indicates when we should be looking at FDR
#' @param return_details TRUE means that the function should return a list of the original data ("detobj"), a summary of the results ("detresults"),  a
#' node level dataset  ("detnodes"), and a copy of the original object that was provided as input. Default here is FALSE. Only use TRUE when
#' not using simulations.

#' If `hit` means that $p \le \alpha$ for a given block or group of blocks where testing has stopped, `allnull` means that all of the effects in the group of blocks (or the single block) are zero, `anynotnull` means that at least one block has a non-zero effect, then this is the code that returns the different basic descriptions of errors.
