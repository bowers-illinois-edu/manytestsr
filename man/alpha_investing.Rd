\title{Alpha adjustment function: Alpha Investing}
\usage{
alpha_investing(pval, batch, nodesize, thealpha = 0.05, thew0 = 0.05 - 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{pval}{Is a numeric vector of p-values}

\item{batch}{A character or factor or even numeric vector indicating grouping among the p-values
and the order of the p-values. The first element pval and first element of batch should be the first p-value
produced in the tree and the subsequent p-values should be produced on the children of that root (or children of the children of the root, etc.)}

\item{nodesize}{Is vector indicating the information used to create each p-value. For example, it could be the number of observations, or a weighted version.}

\item{thealpha}{Is the overall error rate for a given test}

\item{thew0}{Is the starting "wealth" of the alpha investing procedure}
}
\value{
A vector of alpha values
}
\description{
These function accept a vector of p-values and vector indicating batch of p-values
It produces a vector of alpha values.
}
\examples{
# Example with hierarchical testing scenario
# Simulate p-values from different levels of a tree
pvals <- c(0.01, 0.04, 0.12, 0.08, 0.15, 0.02)
batches <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)  # Tree depth levels
node_sizes <- c(100, 50, 50, 25, 25, 25)  # Sample sizes at each node

# Apply alpha investing procedure
alpha_vals <- alpha_investing(pvals, batches, node_sizes, thealpha = 0.05)

# Compare p-values to adjusted alpha levels
data.frame(
  pval = pvals,
  batch = batches,
  alpha = alpha_vals,
  significant = pvals <= alpha_vals
)
