\arguments{
\item{idat}{Individual level data}

\item{bdat}{Data at the block level.}

\item{blockid}{A character name of the column in idat and bdat indicating the block.}

\item{trtid}{Is the name of the treatment numeric, (0,1), variable}

\item{fmla}{A formula with outcome~treatment assignment  | block where treatment assignment and block must be factors.}

\item{ybase}{Is the potential outcome to control upon which the treatment effect will be built}

\item{prop_blocks_0}{Is the proportion of blocks with no effects at all}

\item{tau_fn}{Is a function that turns ybase into the potential outcome under treatment --- it is a treatment effect creating function.}

\item{tau_size}{Is the parameter for the tau_fn --- like the true average effect size within a block.}

\item{pfn}{A function to produce pvalues --- using idat.}

\item{afn}{A function to adjust alpha at each step. Takes one or more p-values plus a stratum or batch indicator.}

\item{nsims}{Is the number of simulations to run --- each simulation uses the same treatment effects be re-assigns treatment (re-shuffles treatment and re-reveals the observed outcomes as a function of the potential outcomes)}

\item{ncores}{Tells p-value functions how many cores to use. Mostly ignored in use of this function because we are tending to parallelize at higher loops.}

\item{splitfn}{A function to split the data into two pieces --- using bdat}

\item{covariate}{is the name of a covariate to be used in created covariate dependent treatment effects}

\item{splitby}{A string indicating which column in bdat contains a variable to guide splitting (for example, a column with block sizes or block harmonic mean weights or a column with a covariate (or a function of covariates))}

\item{thealpha}{Is the error rate for a given test (for cases where alphafn is NULL, or the starting alpha for alphafn not null)}
}
\value{
A pvalue for each block
}
\description{
This function returns a function that carries with it the environment containing the arguments.
The idea is to make parallelization easier.
