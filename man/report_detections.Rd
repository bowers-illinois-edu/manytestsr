\title{Return detected blocks plus info}
\usage{
report_detections(
  orig_res,
  fwer = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.05,
  only_hits = FALSE,
  blockid = "blockF"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{orig_res}{results data.table output from the \code{\link{find_blocks}} function.}

\item{fwer}{(default is TRUE) means that a block is detected (or not) using the maximum p-value associated with the
block (or the groups containing that block). fwer=FALSE to detect blocks (or groups of blocks) using FDR control.}

\item{alpha}{Is the false positive rate used for detecting an effect if it is constant (i.e. not an FDR-style approach).}

\item{only_hits}{(default FALSE) returns only the detected blocks instead of all of them}

\item{blockid}{Name of block variable (the blocking variable is a factor)}
}
\value{
A data.table adding a column \code{hit} to the \code{res} data.table
indicating a "hit" or detection for that block (or group of blocks)
}
\description{
Given the results of the splitting and testing algorithm, report on the
blocks where the null of no effects could be rejected at level alpha.
Currently calculates rejections using an FWER style criteria (p of a node =
max of all previous nodes) if the final alphas are all the same as the
scalar alpha OR if fwer=TRUE.
