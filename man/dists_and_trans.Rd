\title{Outcome distances and transformations}
\usage{
dists_and_trans(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Is a numeric vector (the  outcome variable)}
}
\value{
A list  for inclusion in a data.table with  distances between each unit and other units as well as some transformations of those distances
}
\description{
Outcome distances and transformations
}
\examples{
# Example with continuous outcome data
outcome <- c(2.1, 5.3, 1.8, 7.2, 3.4, 4.6)

# Compute distance-based transformations
dist_results <- dists_and_trans(outcome)

# View components
str(dist_results)
print(dist_results$mean_dist)     # Mean distance to all other units
print(dist_results$rankY)         # Ranks of original values
print(dist_results$tanhY)         # Hyperbolic tangent transformation
