\title{P-value function: T-test}
\usage{
pOneway(
  dat,
  fmla = YContNorm ~ trtF | blockF,
  simthresh = 20,
  sims = 1000,
  parallel = "no",
  ncpu = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An object inheriting from class data.frame}

\item{fmla}{outcome~treatment factor | block factor (following \code{coin} API).}

\item{simthresh}{Below which number of total observations should the p-value
functions use permutations rather than asymptotic approximations}

\item{sims}{Either NULL (meaning use an asymptotic reference dist) or a
number (meaning sampling from the randomization distribution implied by the
formula)}

\item{parallel}{Should the function use multicore processing for permutation
based testing. Default is no. But could be "snow" or "multicore" following
\code{approximate} in the coin package.}

\item{ncpu}{is the number of workers (for "snow") or cores (for "multicore").}
}
\value{
A p-value
}
\description{
These functions accept a data frame and perhaps test specific arguments
(like whether or not the test will be asymptotic or simulation based). It
produces a p-value.
}
\examples{
# Example using built-in data
data(example_dat, package = "manytestsr")

# Test for treatment effect on Y1 within a single block
single_block <- subset(example_dat, blockF == "B080")
p_val <- pOneway(single_block, Y1 ~ trtF | blockF, parallel = "no")
print(p_val)

# Test with permutation-based inference for small samples
p_val_perm <- pOneway(single_block, Y1 ~ trtF | blockF,
  simthresh = 100, sims = 500, parallel = "no"
)
print(p_val_perm)
