\title{Outcome e-distances between treatment arms}
\usage{
edisti(x, Z)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Is a numeric vector (the  outcome variable)}

\item{Z}{is a binary numeric vector or a  factor vector with  only  two values}
}
\value{
Vector with  the individual level components of the energy distances between each unit and the units in  the control condition
}
\description{
Outcome e-distances between treatment arms
}
\examples{
# Example with treatment and control groups
outcome <- c(2.1, 5.3, 1.8, 7.2, 3.4, 4.6, 6.1, 2.8)
treatment <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)  # Binary treatment indicator

# Compute energy distances
e_dists <- edisti(outcome, treatment)
print(e_dists)

\dontrun{
# With factor treatment variable
treatment_factor <- factor(treatment, labels = c("Control", "Treatment"))
e_dists2 <- edisti(outcome, treatment_factor)
print(e_dists2)
